  <h1>About Me</h1>
<p> My name is Demi Deletang. I was born in Olympia, Washington in 1995 and was raised in a small rural town called Packwood. Art has always been a big part of my life, it helps me escape form the world.
I participated in Photographer's Forum 34th annual photo contest and ended up becoming a finalist and my photo was published. I placed second in all of Washington in the Congressional Art Competition, where I had the honor of meeting the congress women Jaime Herrera Beutler. I am currently attending school at Eastern Washington University where I'm pursuing a BA in Visual Communication Design and a Minor in Art. I enjoy painting, drawing, ceramics and photography.</p>
